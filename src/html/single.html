					Color-coding offers an easy way to differentiate which cleaning items are used for which surfaces and
					rooms.
					Designate
					different color rags and sponges for different rooms to ensure that you aren’t spreading bathroom germs
					on
					kitchen
					counters. This also offers a fun way to get children involved with small cleaning tasks by incorporating
					their favorite
					colors.

				<h3>Get Help from Professional Cleaning Services</h3>
				<p>
					One of the best ways to keep your home clean and protected against germs is to call in help from
					professional cleaners,
					like MaidPro. The health and safety of our customers is top priority and we are taking extensive measures
					to ensure that
					we are providing the best clean possible while maintaining high safety standards.
					All of our supplies are disinfected and freshly laundered before each clean and our MaidPro staff is
					screened daily to
					check for any symptoms of illness. Our MaidPro cleaning staff sanitizes before entering your home, stays
					at least six
					feet away from anyone in the home throughout the entire service, uses hospital-grade cleaning products on
					high-touch
					surfaces and follows a specific cleaning route to ensure that they are cleaning and disinfecting from top
					to bottom,
					ending at the front door. All measures are put in place to ensure that you can feel safe throughout the
					entire service.
					Overall, residential cleaning is a powerful tool in preventing the spread of COVID-19, the flu and other
					viruses. With
					these tips, individuals can feel safer and more secure in their living spaces, knowing that they are
					taking the
					necessary precautions to help protect themselves and their families against harmful bacteria and germs.
